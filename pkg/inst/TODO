TODO list for the MuMIn package:

*   model.names: return a textual representation of the model
*   model.avg: checking for consistency of contrasts used in the models
**  handling random effects in 'dredge' (in lme and lmer). Currently 'varying'
        may be used with lme for that purpose
**  add a 'keep' argument for 'dredge' to return (a subset of) models (similarly
        as in 'model.avg' attr(*, 'modelList'))
**  allow model.avg directly on dredge output without re-fitting the models
        (add the list of coeffficient tables as attribute). Note that prediction
		would be not allowed on such an averaged model
