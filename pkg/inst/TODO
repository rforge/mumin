TODO list for the MuMIn package:

*   model.names: return a textual representation of the model
*   model.avg: checking for consistency of contrasts used in the models
**  handling random effects in 'dredge' (in lme and lmer). Currently 'varying'
        may be used with lme for that purpose
**  add a 'keep' argument for 'dredge' to return (a subset of) models (similarly
        as in 'model.avg' attr(*, 'modelList'))
*   consistent ordering of columns in 'model.selection' tables
*   the same argument order in all 'model.sel' methods (add rank argument to the
        generic function)
