Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root of variance). 
	Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed to MuMIn - MUltiModelINference.
